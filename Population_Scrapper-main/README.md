# Population_Scrapper
This is just a practice of my knowledge about BeautifulSoup. In this application I made a small application which scrapes data from worldometers.info website on given country name. Then it cleans that data, converts it into the Pandas DataFrame and stores it into the Excel and CSV formats with the help of Pandas.
Sample Input:  germany
Output: data of germany's population (current and historic) (from this link: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/germany-population/)
